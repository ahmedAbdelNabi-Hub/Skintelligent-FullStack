## 🧱 Architecture

Follows **Onion Architecture** principles:
- **Domain Layer** (Entities, Specifications)
- **Application Layer** (DTOs, Interfaces, Services)
- **Infrastructure Layer** (EF Core, Identity, Hangfire, SignalR)
- **API Layer** (Controllers, Filters, Middleware)

Emphasizes:
- Loose coupling
- Testability
- Separation of concerns

---

## 🔄 Design Patterns Used

- **Repository Pattern** – Abstract data access
- **Unit of Work** – Transactional consistency
- **Specification Pattern** – Encapsulate complex queries
- **Extension Methods** – Reusable transformations and mapping

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit tests for service layer (using xUnit or NUnit)
- Mocked data access with in-memory repositories
- Integration tests for API endpoints
